# Mocha needs YOU!

*Did you know* Mocha [is a dependency of over 100,000 projects](https://libraries.io/npm/mocha) published to npm alone?

**Despite this, we're currently unable to merge most pull requests due to lack of maintenance resources.**

**Are you interested in triaging issues or reviewing open PRs?  Have some time to hack on its codebase?**  If you would like to help maintain Mocha, please contact `@boneskull` on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/mochajs/mocha).

*Thank you* :kissing_heart: to all of y
